Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.80,0:05:51.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So you were going to hunt with a flamethrower and a rocket launcher?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.84,0:05:59.68,Default,,0,0,0,,No, I don't mean that I would do something like that, I like to eat the meat, see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.68,0:06:06.24,Default,,0,0,0,,It's no use if the animal is charred or in a thousand little pieces but,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.24,0:06:11.32,Default,,0,0,0,,it should still be allowed, in case someone wants to hunt like it. Whatever floats your boat.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.32,0:06:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Isn't it a little extreme hunting with that kind of equipment?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.84,0:06:37.44,Default,,0,0,0,,If we want to hunt like this, it's god damnit just like we want to do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.44,0:06:43.24,Default,,0,0,0,,If some Brussels' sir wants to ban this then damn it we'll blow up the whole Brussels.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.24,0:06:52.08,Default,,0,0,0,,We talked and decided that if this is how it's going to go we'll march there and blow the whole place up.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.40,0:07:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I have nothing else to say. I've said enough for them to think about. Bye.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.16,0:07:07.96,Default,,0,0,0,,What is there to add to that?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.20,0:07:20.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Grapevines are here. Next up, some music. I'm going to get coffee.
